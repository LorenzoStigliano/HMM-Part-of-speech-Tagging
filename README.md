# HMM-Part-of-speech-Tagging
This is my assignment for the FNLP course (Foundations of Natural Language Processing) at the University of Edinburgh.
# Introduction
This assignment will make use of the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) for Python. NLTK is a platformfor writing programs to process human language data, that provides both corpora and modules. The assignment is split into 2 sections: Section 1 - Training a Hidden Markov Model and Section 2 - Implementation of the Viterbi Algorithm.
# Section 1 - Training a Hidden Markov Model
In this part of the assignment you have to train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for part-of-speech (POS)tagging.You will need to create and train two models—an Emission Model and a Transition Model.
# Section 2 - Implementation of the Viterbi Algorithm
In this part of the assigmnet you have to implement the Viterbi algorithm. The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states—called the Viterbi path—that results in a sequence of observed events, especially in the context of Markov information sources and hidden Markov models (HMM).
